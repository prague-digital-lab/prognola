# What's Prognola?

Prognola is a financial app for organizations that want to be in control of their money.
The application allows you to record income and expenses and plan your organization's budget for the future.

Project is in alfa version and UI is translated only to czech language. (English localisation is coming soon.)
We plan to prepare Docker compose [self-hosted installation](https://github.com/prague-digital-lab/prognola-self-hosted).

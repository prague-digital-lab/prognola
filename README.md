# What's Prognola?

**Prognola** is a financial app designed for organizations that want full control over their money. It helps you track income and expenses, plan your organization's budget, and gain insights into your financial health.

The project is currently in the **alpha version**, with the user interface translated into **Czech only** (English localization is coming soon). We are also preparing a [Docker Compose self-hosted installation](https://github.com/prague-digital-lab/prognola-self-hosted) for easy deployment.
